      <h1> About me</h1>
      <p>
       I am strategic, highly focused, goal oriented person and an achiever. In my free time, I practice writing, listen to music,  and learn something new. I believe with my clear understanding of user studies (asking the right questions and choosing the right research methods/tools) I can help your company to achieve your goal. I am highly enthusiastic about human factors research and I have 2 years of research experience (qualitative and quantitative) in user studies. Previously, I have worked in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

	<h3>Project Works</h3>
	<p>
•   Determining barriers in learning MATLAB programming. (Winter 2017)<br>
Role: It was a team project and as a leader I made major study design decisions. I also performed
statistical data analysis.<br>
Process: It was an observational lab study with 6 users having no previous experience in MATLAB.
Users were asked to think aloud during the task session. We screen record the entire session.<br>
Results: All users reported to have difficulty understanding the code (syntax and complexity) provided
in the tools help option. This finding can be used to improve usability of MATLAB tools help feature.
